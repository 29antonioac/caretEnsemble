Description: This package is built around 3 functions: caretList, caretEnsemble,
    and caretStack.  caretList is a conviencence function for fitting multiple
    caret::train models to the same dataset.  caretEnsemble will make a linear
    combination of these models using greedy forward selection, and caretList
    will make linear or non-linear combinations of these models using a caret
    model as a meta-model.  Custom caret models are not yet supported.
    Multi-class classification and combinations mixing classification and
    regression models in one ensemble are also not yet supported.
