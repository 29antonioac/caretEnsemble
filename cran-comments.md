This is a new submission to CRAN.  It is a package for creating ensembles of
caret models using greedy selection or other caret models.  It also has a helper
function for fitting many caret models to one set of re-sampled data.

# R CMD CHECK passes on:
## Mac (via `devtools::check()` on my local machine):
No error, warnings, or notes

## Ubuntu (via travis-ci on github)
No error, warnings, or notes

## Windows (via `devtools::build_win()`)
1 Note: New submission (maintainer) I think it is safe for me to ignore this
